- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
if we have data of numbers the z-score calculates how much the data set differentiate from the average if it's above the average it'll returns a positive value else it will returns a negative value.
The min-max it takes a data set, and compute it to a numbers between 0 and 1, to return a value, that value is a percentage of the difference between the highest value and lowest
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
This is my first time working with Unit Testing,
Unit testing is a software development method in which the smallest testable parts of an application, 
referred to as units, are individually and independently scrutinized for correct operation. 
This testing technique is carried out at some point of the improvement method by the software program builders and sometimes QA staff

- What is the IDE did you use?
```
Intellij and eclipse
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
java.io
java.math
java.util
java.nio
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
The only thing i found it a bit difficult is working with BigDecimal & the implementation of z-score and min-max. 
Everything else i was experienced with it so yeah that's it.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
write your answer here
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes, leaned how to use BigDecimal in calculations, and some math methods that i didn't know about them before. :)
```
